# Integration Backend (FastAPI)

This is the FastAPI backend for the Unified JIRA-Confluence Interface.

## Features
- Health and readiness endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`)
- OpenAPI docs at `/docs` and `/openapi.json`
- CORS configured for local frontend development and preview environments (configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS`)
- Atlassian OAuth 2.0 endpoints for JIRA/Confluence
- Docker HEALTHCHECK probing `/ready`

## Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`)

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   - Do not commit secrets
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the server (default port is 3001):
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001
   ```

## Docker
Build and run:
```
docker build -t integration_backend .
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env integration_backend
```

Readiness/Health:
- Container includes a HEALTHCHECK that polls `http://127.0.0.1:${APP_PORT:-3001}/ready`
- If your platform provides `PORT`, it will be used automatically via `run.sh` (mapped to `APP_PORT`)

CORS notes:
- By default, `CORS_ORIGINS=*` to ease preview/dependency checks.
- For stricter environments, set `CORS_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of allowed origins.

## Endpoints
- `GET /` - Root info
- `GET /health` - Liveness probe
- `GET /ready` - Readiness probe
- `GET /api/v1/auth/status` - Auth status placeholder
- `GET /api/v1/integrations/jira/ping` - JIRA connectivity placeholder
- `GET /api/v1/integrations/confluence/ping` - Confluence connectivity placeholder
- `GET /api/v1/auth/atlassian/login` - Redirects to Atlassian's OAuth 2.0 authorization page (JIRA-specific authorize URL with exact parameters)
- `GET /api/v1/auth/atlassian/callback` - Handles Atlassian redirect, validates state, exchanges code for tokens

### JIRA
- `POST /api/v1/jira/issues/search` - Search issues with JQL
  - Body: `{ "jql": "project=TEST ORDER BY created DESC", "max_results": 25, "fields": ["summary","status"] }`
- `POST /api/v1/jira/issues` - Create issue
  - Body: `{ "fields": { "project_key": "TEST", "summary": "Title", "description": "Desc", "issuetype_name": "Task" } }`

### Confluence
- `GET /api/v1/confluence/pages/{page_id}` - Read a page with body.storage and version
- `PUT /api/v1/confluence/pages/{page_id}` - Update page content (storage) and title
  - Body: `{ "title":"Optional", "body_storage_value":"<p>html</p>", "body_storage_representation":"storage", "version": 2 }`

## Atlassian OAuth 2.0

This backend supports Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow for JIRA and Confluence APIs.

1. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/atlassian/callback
   ```
   - The redirect URI must match exactly what you configure in the Atlassian Developer Console.

2. Start the flow by visiting:
   - `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/atlassian/login`

3. After granting consent, Atlassian redirects to the callback:
   - `GET /api/v1/auth/atlassian/callback?code=...&state=...`

4. The backend validates `state` and exchanges `code` for tokens with Atlassian. The callback returns:
   - HTML success/error page by default
   - Or JSON if you pass `?format=json`

Security notes:
- A short-lived, one-time-use state token is used to protect against CSRF. In production, back this with a user session or a persistent store (e.g., Redis).
- This sample implementation does not persist tokens. Integrate with your user model and secure storage to save `access_token` and `refresh_token`.

Scopes:
- The login endpoint requests commonly used scopes for JIRA and Confluence. Adjust scopes to your needs.
```text
offline_access read:jira-user read:jira-work write:jira-work
read:confluence-space.summary read:confluence-content.all write:confluence-content
read:confluence-props read:me
```

## Example JIRA OAuth Authorize URL (Exact Format)

The backend's `GET /api/v1/auth/atlassian/login` endpoint now constructs the Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Authorization URL using the exact JIRA-specific format:

```
https://auth.atlassian.com/authorize?audience=api.atlassian.com&client_id={client_id}&scope=read%3Ajira-work%20read%3Ajira-user%20write%3Ajira-work%20manage%3Ajira-webhook%20manage%3Ajira-data-provider%20manage%3Ajira-project%20manage%3Ajira-configuration&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&state={state}&response_type=code&prompt=consent
```

Where the placeholders are substituted as follows:
- `{client_id}` comes from environment variable `ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID`
- `{redirect_uri}` comes from environment variable `ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI`
- `{state}` is a required, secure token generated by the backend (or can be provided by the client and validated by the backend)

Important:
- The list of scopes and their URL-encoded representation is fixed as shown above for JIRA integration.
- The endpoint ensures `audience=api.atlassian.com`, `response_type=code`, and `prompt=consent` are set.
- The `state` parameter is always included; if not supplied by the client, the backend generates and stores a cryptographically secure one-time token for validation during the callback.

Environment variables to set:
```
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/atlassian/callback
```

Security notes about `state`:
- A short-lived, one-time-use `state` is generated when not provided and stored in-memory for validation.
- On callback, `state` is validated and consumed. For multi-instance deployments, use a persistent store (e.g., Redis) bound to the user session.
- Clients may pass their own `state` when calling `/api/v1/auth/atlassian/login`; the backend will still store and validate it on the callback.

How to use:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/atlassian/login` to be redirected to Atlassian's consent page for JIRA.
- After consent, Atlassian redirects to `${ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI}` with `?code=...&state=...`, which the backend processes at `GET /api/v1/auth/atlassian/callback`.

## Environment variables
See `.env.example` for a complete list. Required for OAuth:
- `ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID`
- `ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ATLASSIAN_REDIRECT_URI`

Optional:
- `JIRA_BASE_URL` and `CONFLUENCE_BASE_URL` (otherwise auto-discovered via accessible-resources)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`, `APP_PORT`, etc.

## Important notes
- Tokens are cached in-memory for demo/dev only and are not persisted. In production, implement user authentication and securely store tokens per user with refresh flows.
- The backend attempts to determine cloud base URLs automatically; set env overrides if discovery isn't suitable for your org.
